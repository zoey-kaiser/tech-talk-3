## The prompt

The prompt for this challenge is:

> Who needs hours and minutes? Make a clock that measures time in the strangest way you can imagine.

You can interperate this prompt as freely as you want! Anything is allowed as long as you complete it within the 30 minutes!

## Instructions

In your teams, you will have 30 minutes to complete a small application concerning itself with a certain prompt. You will be provided with a Stackblitz instance that you can use for coding, however you are also welcome to clone the starter or create your own locally, based on your preference. However, keep in mind that this may cost you some time.

The goal of this challenge is to have fun and work together with people you may not normally work with during your normal workdays. Therefore, donâ€™t stress, take it relaxed and have some fun (side conversations are always welcome!). You do not need to fully complete the challenge, it would however be nice to show something to the others!

## Schedule

- **17:45** - Introduction and any open questions.
- **17:55** - We split up into groups and begin our projects. For this, everyone will receive a GitHub (and Stackbliz) link to a Nuxt 3 starter built with a minimal sidebase instance. The README will then include the prompt for the quick project! You can clone and edit the project locally or use the Stack Blitz.
- **18:30** - Every group will have 5 minutes to present what they created This will be a high-level run-through of what you built, without diving too much into the code.
- **19:00** - We head off into our Feierabend!
